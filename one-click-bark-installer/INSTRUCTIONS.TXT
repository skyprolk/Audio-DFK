# Installation

Run:
    INSTALL_bark_infinity_windows.bat

(After Install, close terminal window)

Start:
  LAUNCH_already_installed_bark_infinity_windows.bat


To launch the CLI or troubleshoot the Bark Setup Environment.
  TROUBLESHOOT_bark_setup_manually_by_entering_the_conda_environment.bat

# Updating the web UI

Run the "INSTALL_bark_infinity_windows.bat" and it may update. But you may have 

1. Run "TROUBLESHOOT_bark_setup_manually_by_entering_the_conda_environment.bat"
2. Type "cd bark"
3. Type "git pull"


This setup is not super optimized, I actually just backed down some versions to make it install more reliably. 
I will create a second option for a more cutting edge faster libraries on the install later. Right now just wanted it to WORK for everyone.

# Adding flags like --chat, --notebook, etc

Edit the "start_up_already_installed_bark_infinity_windows.bat" script using a text editor and add the desired flags
to the CMD_FLAGS variable at the top. It should look like this:

"""
# Gradio flags

--share               Enable share setting.
--user USER           User for authentication.
--password PASSWORD   Password for authentication.
--listen              Server name setting.
--server_port SERVER_PORT
--no-autolaunch       Disable automatic opening of the app in browser.
--debug               Enable detailed error messages and extra outputs.
--incolab             Default for Colab.
"""
